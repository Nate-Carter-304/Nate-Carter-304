- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nate-Carter-304
- 👀 I’m interested in hand tool wood working, riding motorcycles, and the next new skill to learn. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis with R
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a great many things, however be advised, "the only thing I know for sure is that I know nothing for sure"-Socrates. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be emailed at talesfromthequeenseat@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: This whole adventure is aimed at helping those hit hardest by the opiod epedimic who want to start buisness succeed. So I do most of my work on the barter system.  The idea is, if I can help their buisness become successful than we will all be successful and my hometown can enjoy a renaissance.
